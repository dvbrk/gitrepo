    <p>Expressionism is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
    </div>">Expressionism</a> in modern art. Van Goghâ€™s art became astoundingly popular after his death, especially in the late 20th century,
    when his work sold for record-breaking sums at auctions around the world and was featured in blockbuster touring exhibitions. In part because of his extensive published letters, van Gogh has also been mythologized in the popular imagination as the
    quintessential tortured artist.</p>
